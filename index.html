        My name's Will Reynolds and I am a front-end
        developer located in Colorado Springs, CO. With the pandemic, I have
        taken the extra time at home to learn some new skills, in hopes
        of finding a full-time job as a web developer! Through online resources,
        such as SkillShare and Linkedin Learning, I have been able to learn HTML,
        CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. With the basics of web development down, I
        have been searching for a front-end developer job, while I continue to
        learn more web development skills.

        More about me personally, I graduated from Dallas Baptist University in 2017.
        I worked in Dallas for a year after graduating, but then got a job in
        Westcliffe, CO in 2018. I worked in Westcliffe for a year, where I also
        met my wife, Brittany. We dated long distance for awhile before deciding
        to not only get married in Colorado, but to move up here too! In a crazy
        week, my wife and I moved to Colorado Springs and got married this past
        September where it's us and our Australian Shepherd, Baxter! We enjoy
        hiking, reading, coffee, podcasts, and safely exploring our new town.
